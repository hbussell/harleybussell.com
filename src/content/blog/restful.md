Restful has been a big project for me and my wife for a few years now with the goal to create a platform for Tahlee's meditone music. 
The original idea started as a way to replace the wordpress site where people could purchase ablums into a subscription based service.

The first version of the app was a Progressive Web App built with React and Firebase. Being a web app made the transition from previous site simpler and avoiding the Apple app store tax was appleaing. 
We had seen stories of other music based PWA projects running into technical issues on mobile browsers, mostly cenetering around mobile Safari. But I wanted to see if it was possible on the web and based on my own tests for the type of player I wanted it seemed to work. So we pushed foward with the project and ended up lauching a new product using a web player that allowed custom playlists and worked offline with track download support. 
All looked great for while until we heard from some users about issues with track downloads on mobile Safari. Even though we had tested there was some cases that we couldn't replicate with our small set of iphones.
The bugs stacked ontop of users asking how to find the app on the App store made it clear the idea of a web product was the wrong direction so it was time to make a fully native mobile app.

When we shifted to native it was a chance to rethink the branding and design so we hired a pro to come up with some amazing designs to help us make a great looking app.
